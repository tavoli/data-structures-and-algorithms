# Data Structures and Algorithms

The goal of this repository is self-learning. As I came to understand a topic I've decided to write down here.
The result that I want to obtain from this is to stick the information on my brain and check if I'm really learning.

# Introduction

Data structures and Algorithms focuses on problem solving, so for us as programers this knowledge is so essencial as fuel to a car.
The programers skills to solve daily problems are very grounded on this knowledge and experience. So, the importance.

# What are Data Structures?

When solvig a problem using algorithms the way that we choice to store data really matter. 
Data Structures can be understood as a strategically way to store data in which it can be accessed and manipulated on computers memory efficiently.
So the data structure will be boldy dependent about the problem we want to solve. 
We can also separate the structures in primitive which includes integers, booleans, floats, characters and the complex ones, such lists, arrays, trees and graphs.

# RAM

# Static Arrays

# Dynamic Arrays
